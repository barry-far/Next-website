# Barry Fardar Portfolio Website üöÄ

This repository contains the open source version of my interactive portfolio website, built to showcase creative development and design skills using modern web technologies.

## Features ‚ú®
- **3D Interactive Character**: Real-time rendered character using Three.js, with encrypted model loading and GSAP-driven animations.
- **Tech Stack Visualization**: Animated, physics-based tech stack display using React Three Fiber and Rapier physics.
- **Sections**: About, What I Do, Career, Work, Contact, and more, all with smooth transitions and creative UI.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile experiences.

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite
- **3D & Animation**: Three.js, @react-three/fiber, GSAP, WebGL
- **Physics**: @react-three/rapier
- **UI/UX**: CSS, custom animations, React Icons

## Getting Started üö¶

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm (v9+ recommended)

### Installation

```

## 3D Model & Decryption üîí
- The main character model is stored as an **encrypted file** (`public/models/character.enc`).
- Decryption is handled at runtime in the browser using a password (`Character3D#@`).
- The model is loaded and animated with Three.js and GSAP.
- **Draco compression** is used; ensure the Draco decoder files are present in `public/draco/`.

## GSAP Club Plugins ‚ö†Ô∏è
This project uses GSAP trial plugins for animation. **You cannot host the site with trial plugins.**
- For production/hosting, obtain Club GSAP plugins: [GSAP Club Plugins](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Installation/)
